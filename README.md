# graph_generator
Old (v2.0) and customized Graph500 / RMAT generator based on [Graph500 generator](https://github.com/graph500/graph500)

The main difference is that make_graph use an extra paramater for the MPI Generator: [MPI_COMMUNICATOR](https://github.com/fvella/graph_generator/blame/133d298e8e24717a2bc2d112ef2affa877dd7cc7/generator/make_graph.c#L272)
